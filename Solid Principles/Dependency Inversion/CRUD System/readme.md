# Interview Question: Designing a Repository Layer in a CRUD System Using the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)

---

## Question:

You’re building a simple user management service that supports basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for **User** entities.  
Using the **Dependency Inversion Principle**, design the system so that:

- The **high-level module** (UserService) does **not depend on concrete data access** details.
- Both the high-level module and the low-level data access module depend on an **abstraction** (UserRepository interface).
- The **abstraction does not depend on details**; details (e.g., in-memory or SQL implementations) depend on the abstraction.

---

## How to Add a New Repository (e.g., PostgreSQL)

To introduce a PostgreSQL-backed repository:

Create a new implementation of the UserRepository interface (e.g., SQLUserRepo), and inject it into UserService.

UserService remains unchanged — no need to modify any business logic. Just plug in the new implementation.

## Why This Demonstrates DIP

### High-Level Module (UserService)

- Depends only on the UserRepository interface.
- Does **not** depend on any concrete implementation.

### Low-Level Module (InMemoryUserRepo)

- Implements the UserRepository interface.
- Depends on the **abstraction**, not on UserService.

### Abstraction Independence

- The UserRepository interface sits between UserService and concrete repositories.
- Changes to data access (e.g., switching to SQL) only require a **new implementation** of UserRepository.
- No changes are needed in UserService, keeping core business logic stable and safe.

### Extensibility

- To add a new storage mechanism (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.), simply implement the UserRepository interface.
- Inject the new repository into UserService.
- No need to modify existing logic — adhering to **Open/Closed** and **Dependency Inversion** principles.
- To introduce a PostgreSQL repository:
  ```
    sqlRepo := NewSQLUserRepo(/*db params*/)
    service := NewUserService(sqlRepo)
  ```
