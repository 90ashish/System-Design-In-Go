# üìã Amazon System Design Interview Question: Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

## ‚ùì Question

**Design a Logging System** for an **e-commerce platform** that tracks order processing. The system should adhere to the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**. The logging system should:

‚úÖ Log information related to **Order Processing** events.  
‚úÖ Allow flexible logging to different outputs such as **console**, **file**, or **external monitoring services**.  
‚úÖ Ensure that the **Order Processing logic** remains **separate** from the **Logging logic**.

## üß© Solution in Golang Implementing SRP

### Key Components

1. **OrderProcessor**  
   - Responsible for processing orders.  
2. **Logger**  
   - Responsible for handling logs independently.

## üîé Explanation

‚úÖ **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):**  
- The **OrderProcessor** class is **only responsible** for processing orders.  
- The **Logger** (with implementations like **ConsoleLogger** and **FileLogger**) is **solely responsible** for logging messages.  

‚úÖ **Scalability & Flexibility:**  
- New log destinations (e.g., **external services** like **Amazon CloudWatch** or **ElasticSearch**) can be added **without modifying OrderProcessor**.  
- This design leverages **Dependency Injection**, ensuring **loose coupling**.  

‚úÖ **Real-World Readiness:**  
- The solution is **clean**, **modular**, and adheres to **SRP**, which is crucial for scalable system design.

## üìå Follow-Up Questions Amazon May Ask

1. **How would you extend this to support multiple log levels (INFO, WARN, ERROR, DEBUG)?**  
   - Implement log level filtering within the Logger class to selectively display logs based on severity.  

2. **What changes are needed to implement a retry mechanism for logging failures?**  
   - Introduce a **RetryDecorator** or **Exponential Backoff** strategy in the Logger to ensure log delivery reliability.  

3. **How would you modify the solution to batch log entries for performance improvements?**  
   - Implement a **Buffered Logger** that queues log messages and writes them in batches to improve I/O performance.
