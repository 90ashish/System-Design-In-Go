# 📋 Problem Statement

Uber's **Ride Booking System** requires a robust and reliable solution to manage **distributed transactions** involving multiple services. A typical ride booking process involves multiple steps, such as:

- **Booking a Ride**  
- **Assigning a Driver**  
- **Calculating Fare**  
- **Payment Processing**  
- **Notification Service for Booking Confirmation**  

Each of these steps occurs across multiple services, and failures in any step must trigger **compensating transactions** to ensure data consistency.

## ❓ Question

Design a **Ride Booking System** using the **Saga Pattern** that ensures:

✅ A coordinated workflow across multiple distributed services.  
✅ Automatic rollback (**compensating transactions**) in case of failures.  
✅ Each step of the process is **idempotent** to ensure reliability in retries.  
✅ Ensures **data consistency** across multiple microservices.  
✅ Handles partial failures by invoking necessary **rollback actions**.  

---

## 🧩 Solution Overview

The solution will utilize:

✅ **Saga Pattern** to orchestrate multiple distributed transactions.  
✅ **Choreography-based Saga** where services communicate via event-based messaging.  
✅ Ensures each service implements **compensating actions** for rollback during failures.  
✅ Provides **event-driven communication** between services to ensure better decoupling.  

---

## 📚 Key Takeaways

✅ Uses the **Saga Pattern** to ensure data consistency in a distributed environment.  
✅ Utilizes **compensating transactions** to handle failures effectively.  
✅ Each service step is **idempotent**, ensuring safe retries if needed.  
✅ Supports graceful recovery from partial failures using **rollback mechanisms**.  
✅ Ensures the entire transaction either fully completes or fully rolls back.

## 💬 Bonus Challenge

🔹 Implement a **timeout mechanism** to automatically rollback steps if a service becomes unresponsive.  
🔹 Introduce a **retry mechanism** for temporary failures in critical services like payment.  
🔹 Implement a **monitoring dashboard** to track the status of each step in the Saga.  
🔹 Add support for **event-driven architecture** using Kafka or RabbitMQ for seamless communication between services.
