# 🚀 Singleton Logger Service in Go

## 📋 Problem Statement
Imagine you're building a **Logger Service** for a backend application. The logger should be designed such that:

✅ Only **one instance** of the logger should exist throughout the application lifecycle.  
✅ The logger should support **thread-safe operations** since multiple Goroutines may need to log data concurrently.  
✅ The logger should track how many logs have been recorded.

## ❓ Question
> Design a **Logger Service** using the **Singleton Design Pattern** that ensures only one instance is created. Add functionality to record logs and count the total logs recorded.
