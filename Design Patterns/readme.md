## 🔍 Design Patterns Covered

This repository showcases the following key design patterns in **Golang**:

### 1. 🟦 Singleton Pattern
   - Ensures that a class has **only one instance** and provides a **global point of access** to it.
   - Ideal for configurations, database connections, or managing shared resources.

### 2. 🟨 Factory Method Pattern
   - Provides an interface for creating objects in a **superclass**, but allows subclasses to **alter the type of objects** that will be created.
   - Useful for creating families of related objects without specifying their exact class.

### 3. 🟧 Builder Pattern
   - A step-by-step creation pattern that constructs complex objects by **separating construction logic from representation**.
   - Suitable for constructing objects with numerous optional parameters.

### 4. 🟪 Strategy Pattern
   - Allows selecting a **behavior or algorithm** at runtime by defining a family of algorithms and making them interchangeable.
   - Effective in scenarios requiring multiple algorithms for similar tasks.

### 5. 🟩 Observer Pattern
   - Establishes a **one-to-many dependency** between objects, ensuring that when one object changes state, all its dependents are automatically notified.
   - Commonly used in event-driven systems and notifications.

### 6. 🟫 Decorator Pattern
   - Allows behavior to be added to individual objects without modifying their class by **wrapping objects with new functionality**.
   - Useful for adding flexible, dynamic features to objects.
