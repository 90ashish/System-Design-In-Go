# 📋 Problem Statement

Google’s **Search Engine System** is undergoing a **modernization process**. The existing legacy system has **outdated code**, **complex dependencies**, and **lacks scalability**. The challenge is to gradually refactor the system without disrupting its ongoing functionality.

The system must:

✅ Allow a **smooth migration** from the legacy code to a new codebase.  
✅ Ensure the system remains **operational** throughout the transition.  
✅ Gradually **divert traffic** from the old system to the new system.  
✅ Introduce **new features** directly in the modernized architecture without modifying the legacy system.  

---

## ❓ Question

Design a solution using the **Strangler Pattern** to modernize Google’s Search Engine without causing downtime. The solution should:

✅ Use the **Strangler Pattern** to replace legacy components incrementally.  
✅ Ensure both **legacy** and **modernized code** run concurrently during the transition.  
✅ Provide a mechanism to gradually **divert traffic** from the legacy system to the modern system.  
✅ Allow developers to implement **new features** only in the modernized architecture.  

---

## 🧩 Solution Overview

The solution will utilize:

✅ **The Strangler Pattern** to facilitate incremental modernization by replacing legacy code with modern implementations step by step.  
✅ **Routing Logic** that dynamically directs requests between the **legacy system** and the **new system**.  
✅ A **Feature Toggle System** to enable **gradual rollout** and controlled migration.  
✅ Ensures **zero downtime** during the migration process.

## 📚 Key Takeaways

✅ Utilizes the **Strangler Pattern** to incrementally migrate from the **legacy system** to the **modern system**.  
✅ Ensures **zero downtime** by allowing both systems to run in parallel during migration.  
✅ Implements a **traffic routing logic** that gradually shifts traffic to the new system.  
✅ Allows **new features** to be developed in the modern system without affecting the legacy system.  
✅ Ensures **controlled rollout** with flexibility to **reverse the migration** if issues arise.

## 💬 Bonus Challenge

🔹 Add **metrics monitoring** to track performance differences between the **legacy** and **modern systems**.  
🔹 Implement a **feature toggle mechanism** for even more granular control during the migration.  
🔹 Introduce **logging and auditing** to track requests handled by each system.  
🔹 Enhance **error handling** to gracefully manage failures during the transition.
