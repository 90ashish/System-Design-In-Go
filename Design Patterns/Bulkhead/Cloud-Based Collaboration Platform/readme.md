# 🚀 Microsoft Interview Question: Bulkhead Pattern Challenge

## 📋 Problem Statement

Microsoft's **Cloud-Based Collaboration Platform** requires a robust solution to ensure **service reliability** and **fault isolation** during heavy load conditions. The platform handles multiple services such as:

- **Document Processing Service**
- **Email Notification Service**
- **Data Analytics Service**

To ensure system stability during traffic spikes or performance degradation in one service, the platform must isolate resources to prevent cascading failures and ensure high availability.

---

## ❓ Question

Design a solution using the **Bulkhead Pattern** that:

✅ Ensures **fault isolation** by separating services into distinct resource pools.  
✅ Limits the number of **concurrent requests** per service to prevent system overload.  
✅ Provides a **fallback mechanism** to gracefully handle failed requests.  
✅ Ensures that a failure in one service does not impact the availability of other services.

---

## 🧩 Solution Overview

The solution will utilize:

✅ **Bulkhead Pattern** to isolate services into independent compartments with dedicated resources.  
✅ **Goroutines** to efficiently manage concurrent requests.  
✅ **Buffered Channels** to limit the maximum number of concurrent requests per service.  
✅ A **Fallback Mechanism** to provide alternate functionality when a service is overloaded.

---

## 📚 Key Takeaways

✅ Uses the **Bulkhead Pattern** to isolate services with dedicated resource pools.  
✅ Protects the system from cascading failures by limiting the number of concurrent requests for each service.  
✅ Introduces a **fallback mechanism** to gracefully manage overloaded services.  
✅ Uses **Goroutines** for efficient concurrent request processing.  
✅ Ensures the platform remains **highly available** even during traffic spikes.

## 💬 Bonus Challenge

🔹 Add **timeout logic** to ensure requests that exceed their time limits are automatically canceled.  
🔹 Implement a **circuit breaker pattern** to temporarily block overloaded services for faster recovery.  
🔹 Introduce **metrics and monitoring tools** to track service performance and identify bottlenecks.  
🔹 Add **load balancing logic** to distribute traffic evenly across instances.
